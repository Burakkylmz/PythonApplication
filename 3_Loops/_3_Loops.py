in operator : The 'in' operator is used to check if a value exists in a sequence or not. Evaluates to true if it finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.

'not in' operator- Evaluates to true if it does not finds a variable in the specified sequence and false otherwise.

#For example

5 in [1,2,3,4] #output is False because our list don't contain 5

2 in [1,2,3] #output is True

"t" in "Tesla"

"elo" in "elon musk"

not 4 in (1,2,3) # true

"""
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string). This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
